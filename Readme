Driver compilation and installation
===================================

To get the make options type make help
  make help

tn40xx driver Makefile. Available targets:
  all              - build the driver
  clean            - Clean the driver
  help             - Print this help message
  install          - Install driver to system directory
                     usually, it is /lib/modules/VER/kernel/drivers/net
  default          - all

Special notes for Marvell PHYs:
===============================
	This driver package does not include Marvell PHY firmware files. If you own a TN9210 or TN9710 NIC based on Marvell PHY, you will need to obtain the firmware file in .hdr format prior to compiling this driver

	For TN9210 (DeviceID 4024) please extract the file 88X3140-FW-R02-06-03.hdr from 88X3140-FW-R02-06-03.zip
	For TN9710P (DeviceID 4027) please obtain the file x3310fw_0_3_4_0_9445.hdr
	For TN9710Q (DeviceID 4527) please obtain the file e2010fw_0_3_4_0_9445.hdr

	If you are missing these exact files, the driver will compile without support for these PHYs

        ********************************* Important ***************************************
        xxd is required for compiling TN9210 and TN9710 drivers. On some distributions such as Fedora, it is not installed by default and build will fail. Please make sure xxd is installed prior to building the driver
        ***********************************************************************************

General Notes:
==============
      - Supported kernels: 2.6.32 - 5.x

      - make install should be run by a privileged user after running make:
	sudo make install

      - Ethtool support for 5GBASE-T and 2.5GBASE-T options:
	speed 5000 - 5Gbps
	speed 2500 - 2.5Gbps

Distribution Specific Notes:
===========================

      - in SLES11, set 'allow_unsupported_modules 1'  in /etc/modprobe.d/unsupported-modules
      - in SLES12, set 'allow_unsupported_modules 1'  in /etc/modprobe.d/10-unsupported-modules.conf

      - On Ubuntu, if a new ramfs is not rebuilt after make install and previous driver is loaded after reboot:
	sudo update-initramfs -u -k `uname -r`

      - On Fedora27, you may get the following compilation error:
	Makefile:946: *** "Cannot generate ORC metadata for CONFIG_UNWINDER_ORC=y, please install libelf-dev, libelf-devel or elfutils-libelf-devel".  Stop.
	Please follow the recommendation to install the missing package:
	sudo dnf install elfutils-libelf-devel
